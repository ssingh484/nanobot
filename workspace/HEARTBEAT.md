# Heartbeat Tasks

This file is checked every **1 hour** by Friday.
Each heartbeat, work through the active tasks below. Skip tasks that have no actionable work this cycle.

After completing any autonomous work, **always message Sid** via the active channel to report what was done.

## Active Tasks

- [ ] **Review recent conversations** — Scan conversation history and memories for recurring patterns, pain points, or workflows that could be turned into reusable skills or tools. If something stands out, build the skill/tool autonomously and inform Sid.

- [ ] **Propose novel ideas** — Based on memories, past interactions, and Sid's domains of interest (AppSec, OSCP, homelabbing, programming, travel, anime, fitness), brainstorm and suggest useful automations, tools, or insights Sid hasn't asked for yet. Message proposals to Sid for feedback.

- [ ] **Audit and improve existing tools/skills** — Check current skills and tools for gaps, bugs, or opportunities to make them more robust. Implement improvements autonomously and inform Sid.

- [ ] **Check A2A agent registry** — Review `memory/AGENTS_REGISTRY.md` for known agents. Verify reachability of registered agents with `discover`. Remove stale entries and note any capability changes.
